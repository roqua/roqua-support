# Roqua::Support

This gem contains all sorts of support utilities and helper methods that are
useful to have in RoQua's applications, but have nothing to with the domain.

## Usage

### Logging

```ruby
class Example
  include Roqua::Logging

  def methodname
    # This writes a single line to the event log with
    # the given event name and parameters as key=value format.
    logger.info 'example.eventname', optional: 'extra parameters'
  end

  def another
    # This automatically emits two lines, one for when the
    # block begins, one for when the block ends. ':started',
    # ':finished', ':failed' are appended to the event name
    # given, and the duration of the block is logged with
    # the :finished log line.
    logger.lifecycle 'example.lifecycle', optional: 'params' do
      sleep 5
    end
  end
